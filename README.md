# dct-image-compression-demo
A web-based visual demonstration of JPEG-like image compression using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and thresholding. Built with a Vanilla JavaScript frontend for interactive visualization and a high-performance Rust/WASM backend for efficient computation. This project explores the fundamentals of lossy image compression and serves as an educational tool for understanding JPEG compression techniques.
